# Phase 25 — bootstrap seed policy

`docs/ROADMAP_TAIL.md` §Phase 25 lists *decide how bootstrap binaries are
produced and verified* as work, not as an open decision. This is that
decision, its alternatives, and the ordering it implies. Status and scope for
the phase stay in the tail; this file carries the reasoning, so the tail stays
a summary.

Decided 2026-09-19, after `#398` closed Phase 24's backend retirement.
**Full C removal remains the separate policy decision the tail already names**
— see *What this does not decide*.

## The decision

**Bootstrap from the previous release (option A), with a verified checked-in
binary (option B) as the bridge. Do the runtime before the seed.**

## What the measurement changed

Three facts about the tree at `bae85510` shape this more than any general
bootstrapping argument.

**Rust is already a hard build dependency.** The Cranelift backend is a cargo
crate under `compiler/experiments/cranelift/`, built by `Makefile:181`. So
"remove C" was never "remove the second toolchain"; that boundary was crossed
before Phase 25 opened. An option is not disqualified for needing cargo.

**The seed is one of three C strands, and it is not the cheapest.**

| strand | what | size |
|---|---|---|
| seed | `gust_v4.c`, the compiler as generated C | 66,002 lines |
| runtime | `src/runtime.c` + `src/runtime/*.c`, hand-written, linked into every binary | 1,968 lines |
| linker | `cc` as the linker driver, Patch 18.7 | — |

**There is no release infrastructure.** No releases, no publish workflow; the
only release-named workflow is an audit.

## Options

**A — bootstrap from the previous release.** No seed in the repository; the
build obtains the last released compiler. What Go and Rust do.

**B — checked-in native binary.** A prebuilt `gust` per platform, committed.

**C — checked-in Cranelift object or archive.** `.o`/`.a` rather than an
executable.

**D — generated Rust seed.** Emit the compiler as Rust and `cargo build` it:
text, and the toolchain is already required.

**E — tiny auditable subset compiler.** A minimal Gust-subset compiler small
enough to read, which builds the real one. The Mes / live-bootstrap model.

## Ranking

| | option | assessment |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A** | Removes the seed rather than translating it. The fixed point survives intact: the released compiler builds current source, and current source rebuilds itself byte-identically. Today's `gust_v4.c` can mint the first release, giving a clean one-time cut-over. The cost is release infrastructure this project wants regardless. |
| 2 | **B**, *if the fixed point proves it* | The usual objection is that a blob cannot be diffed. This repository already has the machinery that answers it: require the committed binary to rebuild itself byte-identically from source. That makes the seed **verified rather than trusted**, which is most of what auditability buys. Cost: one artifact per platform. |
| 3 | **C** | Strictly worse than B — still opaque, still per-platform, and still needs a linker, with no compensating advantage. |
| 4 | **D** | Attractive at first glance: text, diffable, toolchain already present. But it is not swapping an emitter, it is **writing a new backend**, and it ends in a 66k-line generated artifact again in a different language. High cost, little gain over A. |
| 5 | **E** | Right in principle, wrong for now. Needs a defined language subset and is plausibly years of work. Recorded so it is not foreclosed. |

## Ordering: the runtime first

The ordering matters more than the choice.

The runtime is 1,968 hand-written lines across eight files, it involves no
emitter, and **every binary links it — including whatever replaces the seed**.
Left until last, each seed option inherits a C dependency it cannot shed, and
the phase's exit gate stays out of reach no matter which seed lands. It is
also the cheapest of the three strands to finish, which makes it the natural
first patch rather than the last.

So: **runtime → seed → linker driver.**

## What this does not decide

**Whether `cc` survives as the linker driver.** Patch 18.7 established it
deliberately (`compiler/mir_target_authority.gst:660-665`) and `#401` defends
it by name. "No host C compiler" may honestly resolve to *no host C compiler,
but still a linker*. That is a policy decision for the operator, and it should
be settled **before** the phase writes its closure sentence rather than
discovered at the gate — which is the trap Phase 24 fell into and spent five
patches climbing out of.

## First step, before any of the above

**Enumerate what actually requires a C toolchain, measured rather than
inherited.**

Phase 24 closed on "28 registered live-C cases". The number was accurate about
the registers and incomplete about the tree: `#398` found four further Stdlib
guards reaching the backend through `GUST_RUNNER_ROUTE` or through rows every
census projects away. The bootstrap chain has the same shape — components that
need a C toolchain without spelling `cc`. An enumeration that starts from the
existing registers will inherit the same blind spot.
